# Open Questions

- We do want a solution on the canvas as a good default solution
  - We can expand it (e.g. Data-View, Cockpit Filter Tab)

These questions have to be answered independent of the solution whe choose

# Modeler

- Will expanded Sub-Processes appear in the Breadcrumbs/Tree-View? Execution Tree
- Undo/Redo Actions across levels
- Variable Scopes inside the new view
- Do we want modelling across Subprocess Borders
  - Message flows from inside the Sub-Process to participant in the Parent
- Which elements are allowed in a sub process (Participants, ...)
- In the modeler, do we want to allow to expand/collapse sub processes with content at any time?

# Cockpit

- Selection from the "Filter" Tab
- Modification across multiple levels
- Heatmap
- Migration
